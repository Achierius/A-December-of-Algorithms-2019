# **Stack up**


---

**Understanding Stacks:**
<br>
* A stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the *last-in first-out* (LIFO) principle. 
* A stack is a limited access data structure - elements can be added and removed from the stack only at the top. push adds an item to the top of the stack, pop removes the item from the top. 
* A helpful analogy is to think of a stack of books; you can remove only the top book, also you can add a new book on the top.
 
**Problem Statement:**<br>
  The task is to reverse a string using stacks.

**Format:**<br>
* Get the string
* Print the reverse of a string using stacks

**Example**:
<br>
Let the string be abcdef
<br>
Reversed string is fedcba
