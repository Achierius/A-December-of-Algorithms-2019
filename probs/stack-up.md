### **December 9 - Stack up**

- **Understanding Stacks:**
	- A stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the *last-in first-out* (LIFO) principle. 
	- A stack is a limited access data structure - elements can be added and removed from the stack only at the top. push adds an item to the top of the stack, pop removes the item from the top. 
	- A helpful analogy is to think of a stack of books; you can remove only the top book, also you can add a new book on the top.

- **Problem**
 	It's day 10! Congrats on completing one-third of the challenge.The task for the day is to reverse a string using stack data structure.

- **Format**
	- Get the string
	- Print the reversed string using stacks

- **Example**

```

	Enter string: abcdef
	The reversed string is: fedcba
```
